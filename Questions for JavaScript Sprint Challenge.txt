  	B. Implicit - a function is called by a preceding dot, the object of the dot gets 'this'

  	C. New - 'new' whenever a constructor function is used, 'this' refers to the specific instance of the object that is created & returned by the constructor function

  	D. Explicit - call or apply method is used, 'this' is explicitly defined
